## Project Description

SolveRift is a mobile application written in Dart using the Flutter framework, designed to simplify mathematical calculations. Aimed at assisting those struggling with math, SolveRift provides an intuitive solution for exercises, guiding users step by step through their resolution.

## Key Features

- **Intuitive Interface:** SolveRift features a simple and engaging user interface, making mathematical calculations on mobile devices a pleasant experience.

- **MathField:** With the use of the Flutter MathField package, users can input mathematical expressions easily and visually, while SolveRift provides instant feedback.

- **Operation History:** Easily monitor and access past operations with the history function, allowing users to review their progress and previous solutions.

- **Equation Scanner from Photo:** Now you can take a photo of the equation directly from the book using the integrated libraries. SolveRift scans the image and interprets the equation to simplify the input.

## How It Works

- **Enter the Expression:** Using the integrated mathematical keyboard, users can input complex expressions and equations.

- **Camera Capture:** If desired, you have the option to take a photo directly from the application using the camera icon button at the bottom right. SolveRift will then scan the image and interpret the equation, simplifying the input process.

- **Step-by-Step Guidance:** SolveRift assists users in resolution, providing real-time feedback during input and guiding through each step.

- **Operation History:** Keep track of your past operations and results, making the app a useful tool for continuous learning.

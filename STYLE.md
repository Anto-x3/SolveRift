# Code Formatting and Style Guidelines

## Programming Language
The SolveRift project uses the Dart programming language. Make sure to follow the specific formatting and style rules for the language.

## Indentation
- Use four spaces for indentation.
- Avoid the use of tabs.

## Parentheses
- Place curly braces on the same line as the control statement.
  ```dart
  if (condition) {
      // Code here
  } else {
      // Other code here
  }

## Line Length
- Limit code line length to 80-120 characters.
- If a line is too long, break it logically.
  ```dart
  // Line length example
  String longText =
    'This is an example of a long text that might exceed the recommended length, ' +
    'so it has been broken into multiple lines to keep it readable.';

## Variable Names
- Use meaningful and descriptive variable names.
- Use camelCase notation for variable names.
  ```dart
  int exerciseNumber;

## Comments
- Add meaningful comments to explain complex code or specific design decisions.
- Avoid obvious and redundant comments.

These guidelines are designed to maintain consistency and readability in the SolveRift project's code. Make sure to adapt them to the specific needs of your project and the preferences of your development team.
